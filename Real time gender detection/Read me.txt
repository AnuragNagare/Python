Real-time Gender Detection System

The above  performs real-time gender detection using the cvlib library in Python.

First, it initializes a video capture object using the cv2.VideoCapture(0) method, where 0 represents the default camera device.

It then starts a loop to read frames from the camera using webcam.read(). For each frame, it detects faces using cv.detect_face(frame) and draws a rectangle around each face using cv2.rectangle().

For each detected face, it crops the face region and passes it to the cv.detect_gender() method to detect the gender. It then draws a label on the frame using cv2.putText(), indicating the detected gender and confidence level.

Finally, it displays the resulting frame in a window using cv2.imshow(). The loop continues until the user presses the "s" key, at which point it stops the video capture using webcam.release() and closes all windows using cv2.destroyAllWindows().
