Real-time Gender Detection System

To create a gender detection system using Python, we need to train a model with some high-level features of the face of human beings such as:

the distance between eyes, nose, and mouth 

and measurements of different parts of the face of both the genders

There are many libraries and frameworks in Python that can be used to create a real-time gender detection system. Some of these libraries include Yolo, Tensorflow, OpenCV, and Cvlib. So here I am going to use the Cvlib library in Python that can be used to detect the gender of a person in a few lines of code.

Along with Cvlib, I will also be using the OpenCV library in Python so that we can detect a person’s gender using a webcam.



If you want to stop this program from running, just press “s” and it will stop your program from running.
