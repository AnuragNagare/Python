code performs real-time face detection using a webcam feed. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Import the necessary modules: cv2 for computer vision tasks, and os to get the file path for the Haar Cascade classifier.
Load the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection using the cv2.CascadeClassifier function. The file path for the classifier is obtained using os.path.dirname(cv2.__file__) to get the directory where OpenCV is installed, and then appending the relative path to the classifier.
Initialize the video capture using cv2.VideoCapture(0) to capture frames from the default camera (index 0).
Start a loop to capture frames from the camera, detect faces, and draw rectangles around the detected faces.
Inside the loop, the current frame is read from the video capture using video_capture.read(). The frame is then converted to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor(), which improves the accuracy of face detection.

The Haar Cascade classifier is then used to detect faces in the grayscale frame using faceCascade.detectMultiScale(). The scaleFactor, minNeighbors, minSize, and flags parameters can be adjusted to improve the accuracy of face detection.

A rectangle is drawn around each detected face using cv2.rectangle(), and the resulting frame is displayed using cv2.imshow(). The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed.

When the loop ends, the video capture is released using video_capture.release(), and all windows are destroyed using cv2.destroyAllWindows()
